    name: "yellow stemborer",
    description: '''
What it does:
Stem borers can destroy rice at any stage of the plant from seedling to maturity.

They feed upon tillers and causes deadhearts or drying of the central tiller, during vegetative stage; and causes whiteheads at reproductive stage.

Why and where it occurs:
The stem borer larvae bore at the base of the plants during the vegetative stage. On older plants, they bore through the upper nodes and feed toward the base.

The yellow stem borer is a pest of deepwater rice. It is found in aquatic environments where there is continuous flooding. Second instar larvae enclose themselves in body leaf wrappings to make tubes and detach themselves from the leaf and falls onto the water surface. They attach themselves to the tiller and bore into the stem.

How to identify
Check the field for the following damage symptoms:

Deadhearts or dead tillers that can be easily pulled from the base during the vegetative stages
Whiteheads during reproductive stage where the emerging panicles are whitish and unfilled or empty
Tiny holes on the stems and tillers
Frass or fecal matters inside the damaged stems
Deadhearts and whiteheads symptoms may sometimes be confused with damages caused by rats, neck blast, and black bug diseases.

To confirm stem borer damage, visually inspect rice crop for deadhearts in the vegetative stages and whiteheads in reproductive stages. Stems can be pulled and dissected for larvae and pupae for confirmation of stem borer damage.

Countermeasures for yellow stemborer.

Why is it important
Excessive boring through the sheath can destroy the crop. Its damage can reduce the number of reproductive tillers. At late infection, plants develop whiteheads.

Yellow stemborer damage can lead to about 20% yield loss in early planted rice crops, and 80% in late-planted crops.
White stemborer is an important pest in rainfed wetland rice. It can cause outbreaks and destroy rice fields.
Striped stemborer is one of the most important insect pests in Asia. Its damage can be as high as 100% when severe.
Gold-fringed stemborer can cause yield loss of about 30%.

How to manage
Use resistant varieties
At seedbed and transplanting, handpick and destroy egg masses
Raise level of irrigation water periodically to submerge the eggs deposited on the lower parts of the plant
Before transplanting, cut the leaf-top to reduce carry-over of eggs from the seedbed to the field
Ensure proper timing of planting and synchronous planting, harvest crops at ground level to remove the larvae in stubble, remove stubble and volunteer rice, plow and flood the field
Encourage biological control agents: braconid, eulophid, mymarid, scelionid, chalcid, pteromalid and trichogrammatid wasps, ants, lady beetles, staphylinid beetles, gryllid, green meadow grasshopper, and mirid, phorid and platystomatid flies, bethylid, braconid, elasmid, eulophid, eurytomid and ichneumonid wasps, carabid and lady bird beetles, chloropid fly, gerrid and pentatomid bugs, ants, and mites,  earwigs, bird, asilid fly, vespid wasp, dragonflies, damselflies, and spiders
Bacteria and fungi also infect the larvae: mermithid nematode, chalcid, elasmid and eulophid
Apply nitrogen fertilizer in split following the recommended rate and time of application.

    name: "brown plant hopper",
    description: '''
What it does:
High population of planthoppers cause leaves to initially turn orange-yellow before becoming brown and dry and this is a condition called hopperburn that kills the plant.

BPH can also transmit Rice Ragged Stunt and Rice Grassy Stunt diseases. Neither disease can be cured.

Why and where it occurs:
Planthoppers can be a problem in rainfed and in irrigated wetland environments. It also occurs in areas with continuous submerged conditions in the field, high shade, and humidity.

Closed canopy of the rice plants, densely seeded crops, excessive use of nitrogen, and early season insecticide spraying also favors insect development.

How to identify:
Check for the presence of insect:

crescent-shaped white eggs inserted into the midrib or leaf sheath
white to brown nymphs
brown or white adults feeding near the base of tillers

Check the field for:
hopperburn or yellowing, browning and drying of plant
ovipositional marks exposing the plant to fungal and bacterial infections
presence of honeydew and sooty molds in the bases of areas infected
plants with ragged stunt or grassy stunt virus disease
Hopperburn is similar to the feeding damage or "bugburn" caused by the rice black bug. To confirm hopperburn caused by planthoppers, check for the presence of sooty molds at the base of the plant.''',
    countermeasures: '''
Countermeasures for Rice brown plant hopper.

How to manage:
Outbreaks result from pesticides destroying natural enemies (BPH eggs hatch unchecked, and surviving BPH quickly build-up populations to damaging levels), or when longwinged planthoppers are being carried in by the wind.

To prevent outbreaks of planthopper:

Remove weeds from the field and surrounding areas.
Avoid indiscriminate use of insecticide, which destroys natural enemies.
Use a resistant variety. Contact your local agriculture office for an up-to-date list of available varities.
Critical numbers: At a density of 1 BPH/stem or less there is still time to act in case the numbers increase.
Look for BPH daily in the seedbed, or weekly in the field, on stems and the water surface. Check each side of the seed bed (or direct-seeded fields). For older rice plants, grasp the plant, bend it over slightly, and gently tap it near the base to see if planthoppers fall onto the water surface. For transplanted rice look at bases of 10 to 20 hills as you cross the field diagonally. There is no need to scout for BPH or WBPH beyond the milk stage.
Use light traps (e.g., an electric bulb or kerosene lamp near a light colored wall or over a pan of water) at night when rice is prone to planthopper attack. Do not place lights near seedbeds or fields. If the light trap is inundated with hundreds of BPH, it's a signal to check your seedbed or field immediately; then scout every day for the next few weeks. If farmers monitor on a daily basis anyway, then a light trap is unnecessary.
To control planthoppers:

Mechanical & physical measures

Flood the seedbed, for a day, so that only the tips of seedlings are exposed will control BPH.
Sweep small seedbeds with a net to remove some BPH (but not eggs), particularly from dry seed beds. At high BPH densities, sweeping will not remove sufficient numbers of BPH from the base of the plant.
Biological control

If natural enemies out-number BPH the risk of hopperburn is low. Even rice already damaged by hopperburn should not be treated with insecticides if natural enemies out-number BPH. Natural enemies of BPH include water striders, mirid bugs, spiders, and various egg parasitoids.
Chemical control

Only apply insecticides to the seedbed, for BPH or WBPH, if all of these conditions are met:

an average of more than one planthopper per stem,
on average, more planthoppers than natural enemies,
flooding the seedbed is not an option.

//     name: "rice leafhopper",
//     description: '''
// What it does:
// Green leafhoppers are the most common leafhoppers in rice fields and are primarily critical because they spread the viral disease tungro. Both nymphs and adults feed by extracting plant sap with their needle-shaped mouthparts.

// Why and where it occurs:
// Staggered planting encourages population growth of GLH.

// Green leafhoppers are common in rainfed and irrigated wetland environments. They are not prevalent in upland rice. Both the nymphs and adults feed on the dorsal surface of the leaf blades rather than the ventral surface. They prefer to feed on the lateral leaves rather than the leaf sheaths and the middle leaves. They also prefer rice plants that have been fertilized with large amount of nitrogen.

// How to identify:
// Rice fields infested by GLH can have tungro, yellow dwarf, yellow-orange leaf, and transitory yellowing diseases.

// Symptoms include:

// stunted plants and reduced vigor
// reduced number of productive tillers
// withering or complete plant drying
// Tungro infected crops may sometimes be confused with nitrogen deficiency or iron toxicity or acid soils. To confirm the cause of the problem, check for virus infected plants in the fields, and the presence of the insect:

// white or pale yellow eggs inside leaf sheaths or midribs
// yellow or pale green nymphs with or without black markings
// pale green adults with or without black markings feeding on upper parts of the crop

// Countermeasures for rice leaf hopper.

// Why is it important:
// Green leafhoppers are important pests. They are vectors of viral diseases such as tungro, yellow dwarf, yellow-orange leaf, transitory yellowing, and dwarf.

// How to manage:
// Use GLH-resistant and tungro-resistant varieties. Contact your local agriculture office for an up-to-date list of available varieties.
// Reduce the number of rice crops to two per year and synchronized crop establishment across farms reduces leafhoppers and other insect vectors.
// Transplant older seedlings (>3 weeks) to reduce viral disease susceptibility transmitted by leafhoppers.
// Plant early within a given planting period, particularly in the dry season to reduce the risk of insect-vector disease.
// Avoid planting during the peak of GLH activity (shown by historical records) to avoid infestation. Light traps can be used to show GLH numbers.
// Apply nitrogen as needed (e.g., using the Leaf Color Chart) to avoid contributing to population outbreaks by applying too much nitrogen, or hindering plant recovery from planthopper damage by applying insufficient nitrogen.
// Control weeds in the field and on the bunds to remove the preferred grassy hosts of GLH and promotes crop vigor.
// Perform crop rotation with a non-rice crop during the dry season to decrease alternate hosts for diseases.
// Intercrop upland rice with soybean to reduce the incidence of leafhoppers on rice.
// In areas without tungro source, insecticides are not needed, avoid spraying of insecticide (it is often unable to prevent or reduce tungro infections).

// Encourage biological control agents: small wasps (parasitize the eggs), mirid bug; strepsipterans, small wasps, pipunculid flies, and nematodes (parasitize both the nymphs and adults), aquatic veliid bugs, nabid bugs, empid flies, damselflies, dragonflies, and spiders, fungal pathogen (attacks both nymph and adult).

// Why and where it occurs:
// The Asian rice gall midge is found in irrigated or rainfed wetland environments during the tillering stage of the rice crop. It is also common in upland and deepwater rice. The adults are nocturnal and can easily be collected using light traps.

// During the dry season, the insect remains dormant in the pupal stage. They become active again when the buds start growing after the rains.

// The population density of the Asian rice gall midge is favored mainly by cloudy or rainy weather, cultivation of high-tillering varieties, intensive management practices, and low parasitization.

// How to identify:
// Symptoms of rice gall midge damage include:

// formation of a hollow cavity or tubular gall at the base of the infested tiller. The gall formed is a silvery white hollow tube, 1 cm wide and 10−30 cm long
// affected tiller inhibits growth of leaves and fails to produce panicles
// deformed, wilted, and rolled leaf
// elongation of leaf sheaths, also called onion leaf or silvershoot
// plant stunting
// The plant stunting and leaf deformity, wilting and rolling are also symptoms observed on plants caused by drought, potassium deficiency, salinity, and ragged stunt virus, orange leaf virus and tungro virus diseases.

    name: "army worm",
    description: '''
What it does?
factsheet-armywormArmyworm feeds on rice by cutting off leaves and young seedlings at the plant's base. They can also cut off rice panicles from base.

Why and where it occurs:
Adult armyworms survive better and produce more eggs when the temperature is at 15°C maximum, and when plants are naturally fertilized. Periods of drought followed by heavy rains, and the presence of alternate hosts also sustain the development of armyworms.

Armyworms are nocturnal.

The larvae usually feed in the upper portion of the rice canopy on cloudy days or at night; while the adult feeds, mates, and migrates at night and rests in daytime at the base of the plant.

In dryland fields, armyworm pupa can be found in the soil or at the base of the rice plants. In wetlands, they pupate on the plants or on grassy areas along the field borders.

How to identify:
Check for feeding damage.

Armyworms feed on leaf tips and along leaf margins. When they eat whole leaves, they can remove them completely or leave only the midribs.

Armyworm damage can be mistaken for cutworm feeding. The characteristic form of armyworm damage is leaf removal. To confirm, check for the presence of the insect and its egg mass.
''',
    countermeasures: '''
Why is it important:
The rice armyworm can be a problem at all stages of the rice crop.

Yield losses can occur when the population is high. It becomes very destructive that it can totally damage the host plant.

During an outbreak, armyworms become highly abundant and can move in large groups from field to field to feed and attack the crops.

How to manage:
Flooding seedbeds is the best defense against armyworms.

To prevent armyworm infestation:

Establish seedbeds far from large areas of weeds.
Plow fallow land.
Clean the field and remove weeds.
To control:

Place ashes in the trenches to make it more difficult for the caterpillars to escape.
Place branches around fields to give armyworms a place to congregate where they are easily collected by hand.
Avoid killing natural enemies of armyworms such as wasps and spiders.
Insecticides should be the last resort for armyworm control.

factsheet-rats

Rice field rats cut or pull up transplanted plants. They also chop down the young seedlings. At booting stage, they feed on rice panicles. On the other hand, during ripening stage, they feed on developing rice grains.

Why and where it occurs:
Rats are found in lowland irrigated rice crops. Both the wet and dry seasons are favorable for rat reproduction and crop damage. In rainfed rice crops rodents have their greatest impact in the wet season. The availability of food, water, and shelter are the factors, which provide optimum breeding conditions. The presence of grassy weeds also triggers their development.

Rice field rats feed at night with high activity at dusk and dawn. At daytime, they are found among vegetation, weeds, or maturing fields. During fallow period, they utilize major channels and village gardens as prime habitats. At tillering, 75% of time they are in burrows along the banks and after maximum tillering, 65% of time they are in rice paddies.

How to identify:
Rat damage in the rice crop can be observed by the following symptoms:

missing germinating seeds
missing hills
chopped young seedlings
missing plants
irregular cuttings of stem
chewed developing buds or ripening grains
tillers cut near base at 45° angle
retillering of stems
delayed grain maturity
missing grains
missing panicles
The feeding damage on the stem caused by the rice field rats may resemble insect damage although rat damage is usually distinguished by the clean cut at 45° of the tiller. The damage on the grains is similar to bird damage.

Check muddy areas for runways, active burrows, and footprints of rice field rats. These are usually near the damage they have created.

Check for presence of rice field rats: cut tillers and active holes on the bunds that surround the fields.

When possible, catch rats to identify the species. Place traps along runways, or dug the rats from their burrows.

Why is it important:
Rattus argentiventer is the major agricultural rodent pest across much of island and mainland Southeast Asia. Crop losses in rice-growing areas due to this species are typically in the order of 10−20%. Losses are generally higher in the second crop in areas with double cropping.

For fields positioned close to refuge habitats such as canals or extensive upland areas, chronic losses of 30−50% are reported. Very high chronic losses are also reported in areas where triple cropping is practiced and rat densities are especially high.

In Malaysia, this species has caused yield losses of 6−11%. In Indonesia, an estimated 17% of the total planted area is estimated to be damaged annually.
''',
    countermeasures: '''
How to manage:
The following are examples of effective community control:

Flooding, digging, or fumigating rat burrows

Scare rats out of areas with high vegetation cover or around villages (using netting, dogs, clubs, and others to catch rats)

Use dogs to locate active rat burrows, then do Step 1

Hunt rats at night using flashlights, clubs, bow and arrows, and netting

Set local kill-traps along runways of rats

Use registered rat poisons that are placed in covered bait stations (but not where children, pets, or livestock have easy access).

While field management includes:
Keeping rice bunds (banks) in the crops less than 30 cm wide to prevent rats from burrowing.

Keeping the edges of the field, the bunds, and surrounding areas clean and free of tall weeds and hiding areas for rats.

Planting at the same time as your neighbors—within 2 weeks of each other.

Strategizing the use of Trap Barrier System (TBS)—during the rice season with the most rodent damage.

Keeping the area around fields, homes, and villages clean — no piles of wood or brush, no garbage heaps, no weedy areas.

Keeping grain stores and surrounding area clean.

    name: "rice blast",
    description:
        '''Blast symptoms can occur on leaves, leaf collars, nodes and panicles. Leaf spots are typically elliptical (football shaped), with gray-white centers and brown to red-brown margins (Figure 1). Fully developed leaf lesions are approximately 0.4 to 0.7 inch long and 0.1 to 0.2 inch wide. Both the shape and the color vary depending on the environment, age of the lesion and rice variety. Lesions on leaf sheaths, which rarely develop, resemble those on leaves.

The most serious damage occurs when the fungus attacks nodes just below the head (Figure 2). The stems often break at the diseased node. This stage of the disease is referred to as “rotten neck.” Disease in the node prevents the flow of water and nutrients to the kernels and they will stop developing. Heads of plants damaged in this way may be completely blank (Figure 3) to nearly normal, depending on the stage of head development when infection occurs. The poorly developed grain usually breaks up badly in milling, reducing quality.
Causal agent
This disease is caused by a fungus named Pyricularia grisea, which overwinters in rice seeds and infected rice stubble. The fungus reproductive structures, spores, can spread from these two sources to rice plants during the next growing season and initiate new infections. Spores from these new infections can spread by wind to other rice plants over great distances.

There are several races of Pyricularia grisea. Race 1B49 has been found in Missouri, but it is not yet known if other races are present.

Control
Use preventive measures:

Incorporate or roll the rice stubble soon after harvest to promote early decomposition.
Plant the least-susceptible varieties and use a broad-spectrum seed treatment.
Grow rice in open fields free of tree lines particularly on east and south sides
Grow rice in fields where flood levels are easily maintained. Damage from blast can be reduced by keeping soil flooded 2 to 4 inches deep from the time rice plants are 6 to 8 inches tall until draining for harvest. Draining for straighthead is incompatible with the flooding required for blast control, so avoid fields with a history of straighthead and varieties susceptible to straighthead, or plant blast-resistant varieties in these fields.
Seed over a range of time to spread the heading dates. However, avoid planting late because blast will be more severe.
Seed to a stand of 15 to 20 plants per square foot.
Avoid excessive nitrogen application rates and apply no more than 30 pounds per acre of nitrogen per application at midseason. In fields with a history of blast, always split applications.

Use fungicides:
Scout fields for blast symptoms from the seedling through heading stages (see Scouting). If symptoms are found, prepare to use fungicides at the late boot stage and again when 80 to 90 percent of plants are headed.

Apply fungicides during the time frame predicted by the DD50 program, which is about 5 to 7 days before heading (late boot stage). Fungicides are especially needed if blast symptoms have been observed in the field and the variety is very susceptible. Fungicides should be applied a second time about two days after 50 percent heading (90 percent head exsertion). In uniform stands, 90 percent heading will occur in 4 to 5 days after the first heads are visible.

The decision to treat is more easily made when one or more of the following factors exist:

A susceptible variety is grown in the field.
The crop has excessive growth and a dense canopy.
Leaf symptoms have been found in the field.
Disease is present in southern parts of the field.
Cool, rainy, or cloudy weather with high humidity and heavy dews is predicted during heading.
The development of this disease is difficult to predict, and fungicide treatments are expensive. Therefore, you should treat on the basis of the above factors or automatically treat the field with a fungicide if you are unwilling to risk disease damage.

Scouting:
Early:
Rice fields should be scouted for leaf symptoms of blast beginning at the seedling stage and continuing until early heading. Leaf symptoms will appear most readily on plants at the edges of fields, on levees, in areas of the fields that are shaded in the morning, or in areas that received excessive nitrogen. Symptoms usually are worse on drought-stressed rice.

If you are uncertain about diagnosing blast symptoms, send a sample to your local MU Extension center for identification. A preboot fungicide application may be needed when foliage damage is severe and the stand is threatened. Proper fertilization and continuous flooding should minimize seedling damage.

Midseason:
You should continue to scout for blast near the heading stage and watch carefully for flagleaf collar symptoms on early-planted susceptible varieties. Also, devote time to determine the stage of rice development to see if the DD50 predicted time frame for fungicide treatment for blast is correct. Symptoms appear 4 to 6 days after infection, so rice heads may be infected without symptoms appearing.

  DiseaseInformation(
    name: "tungro",
    description: '''
What it does:
Rice tungro disease is caused by the combination of two viruses, which are transmitted by leafhoppers. It causes leaf discoloration, stunted growth, reduced tiller numbers and sterile or partly filled grains.

Tungro infects cultivated rice, some wild rice relatives and other grassy weeds commonly found in rice paddies.

Why and where it occurs:
Tungro disease viruses are transmitted from one plant to another by leafhoppers that feed on tungro-infected plants. The most efficient vector is the green leafhopper.

Leafhoppers can acquire the viruses from any part of the infected plant by feeding on it, even for a short time. It can, then, immediately transmit the viruses to other plants within 5−7 days. The viruses do not remain in the leafhopper's body unless it feeds again on an infected plant and re-acquires the viruses.

Tungro infection can occur during all growth stages of the rice plant. It is most frequently seen during the vegetative phase. Plants are most vulnerable at tillering stage.

Tungro incidence depends on the availability of the virus sources and vector population. Other than infected rice plants in the farmer's field, other primary sources for tungro, include:

stubble of previous crops
new growth from infected stubbles that had not been properly plowed under and harrowed effectively
volunteer rice
infected plants in nearby rice fields
Seedlings raised in nurseries or seedbeds can also be infected with Tungro prior to transplanting and can be a primary source of virus.

Transplanting seedlings from nurseries in tungro-infected areas has also shown to increase infection rates in the field, particularly, in cases where seedbed is in a tungro-endemic area or when the nursery duration is 5−6 weeks.

However, this is not believed to be a very strong mechanism in initiating epidemics, because the competitiveness of tungro-infected seedlings is low; they can die rapidly after transplanting.

Why is it important:
Tungro is one of the most damaging and destructive diseases of rice in South and Southeast Asia. In severe cases, Tungro susceptible varieties infected at an early growth stage could have as high as 100% yield loss.

Once tungro is present in the field, it increases rapidly in young rice plants. Leafhopper vectors prefer to feed on young rice plants. They also acquire tungro viruses more efficiently from younger infected plants.

    countermeasures: '''
Countermeasures for tungro.

How to identify:
Check for presence of leafhoppers.

Check leaves for discoloration.

Yellow or orange-yellow discoloration is noticeable in tungro-infected plants. Discoloration begins from the leaf tip and extends down to the blade or the lower leaf portion. Infected leaves may also show mottled or striped appearance, rust-colored spots, and inter-veinal necrosis.

Tungro-infected plants also show symptoms of stunting, delayed flowering which may delay maturity, reduced number of tillers, small and not completely exserted panicles, as well as a higher than normal percentage of sterile panicles or partially filled grains, covered with dark brown blotches.

The degree of stunting and of leaf discoloration varies with rice varieties, strains of the viruses, the age of the plant when infected, and with the environment. In varieties that carry some resistance to the disease, infected plants exhibit no discoloration or only a mild discoloration that may disappear as the plants mature. 

Tungro symptoms can be mistaken for physiological disorders.

Specifically,

the yellowing of the plant and its stunted height can be confused as nitrogen and zinc deficiencies and water stress,
pest infestation such as stem borer infestation, plant hopper infestation, and rat damage, and
other diseases such as grassy stunt virus disease and orange leaf.
Where available, Tungro can be confirmed using serological tools such as Latex agglutination test, Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) and Rapid Immunofilter Paper Assays (RIPA).

How to manage:
Once a rice plant is infected by tungro, it cannot be cured.

Preventive measures are more effective for the control of tungro than direct disease control measures. Using insecticides to control leafhoppers is often not effective, because green leafhoppers continuously move to surrounding fields and spread tungro rapidly in very short feeding times.

The most practical measures at present, include:

Grow tungro or leafhopper resistant varieties.
This is the most economical means of managing the disease. There are tungro-resistant varieties available for the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, and Bangladesh.
Contact your local agriculture office for up-to-date lists of varieties available.
Practice synchronous planting with surrounding farms.
Delayed or late planting, relative to the average date in a given area, makes the field susceptible for Tungro. Late-planted fields also pose a risk to early planting in the next season.
Adjust planting times to when green leafhopper are not in season or abundant, if known
Plow infected stubbles immediately after harvest to reduce inoculum sources and destroy the eggs and breeding sites of green leaf hopper.

  DiseaseInformation(
    name: "bacterial blight",
    description: '''
What it does:
Bacterial blight is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. 

It causes wilting of seedlings and yellowing and drying of leaves.

Why and where it occurs:
The disease is most likely to develop in areas that have weeds and stubbles of infected plants. It can occur in both tropical and temperate environments, particularly in irrigated and rainfed lowland areas. In general, the disease favors temperatures at 25−34°C, with relative humidity above 70%.

It is commonly observed when strong winds and continuous heavy rains occur, allowing the disease-causing bacteria to easily spread through ooze droplets on lesions of infected plants.

Bacterial blight can be severe in susceptible rice varieties under high nitrogen fertilization.

How to identify:
Check for wilting and yellowing of leaves, or wilting of seedlings (also called kresek).

On seedlings, infected leaves turn grayish green and roll up. As the disease progresses, the leaves turn yellow to straw-colored and wilt, leading whole seedlings to dry up and die.

Kresek on seedlings may sometimes be confused with early rice stem borer damage. 

To distinguish kresek symptoms from stem borer damage, squeeze the lower end of infected seedlings between the fingers. Kresek symptoms should show yellowish bacterial ooze coming out of the cut ends. Unlike plants infested with stem borer, rice plants with kresek are not easily pulled out from soil.

Check for lesions:
On older plants, lesions usually develop as water-soaked to yellow-orange stripes on leaf blades or leaf tips or on mechanically injured parts of leaves. Lesions have a wavy margin and progress toward the leaf base.

On young lesions, bacterial ooze resembling a milky dew drop can be observed early in the morning. The bacterial ooze later on dries up and becomes small yellowish beads underneath the leaf.

Old lesions turn yellow to grayish white with black dots due to the growth of various saprophytic fungi. On severely infected leaves, lesions may extend to the leaf sheath.

To quickly diagnose bacterial blight on leaf:

cut a young lesion across and place in a transparent glass container with clear water

after a few minutes, hold the container against light and observe for thick or turbid liquid coming from the cut end of the leaf

    countermeasures: '''
Countermeasures for bacterial blight.
Why is it important:
Bacterial blight is one of the most serious diseases of rice. The earlier the disease occurs, the higher the yield loss.

Yield loss due to bacterial blight can be as much as 70% when susceptible varieties are grown, in environments favorable to the disease.

When plants are infected at booting stage, bacterial blight does not affect yield but results in poor quality grains and a high proportion of broken kernels.

How to manage:
Planting resistant varieties has been proven to be the most efficient, most reliable, and cheapest way to control bacterial blight.

Other disease control options include:

Use balanced amounts of plant nutrients, especially nitrogen.

Ensure good drainage of fields (in conventionally flooded crops) and nurseries.

Keep fields clean. Remove weed hosts and plow under rice stubble, straw, rice ratoons and volunteer seedlings, which can serve as hosts of bacteria.

Allow fallow fields to dry in order to suppress disease agents in the soil and plant residues.
